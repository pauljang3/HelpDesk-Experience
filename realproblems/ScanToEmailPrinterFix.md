# Scan To Email Printer / SMTP Authentication Fix
## Summary
- In this real-world problem I troubleshooted, I was working in a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) network for a law firm.
- This was one of my first problems I've troubleshooted (handled it on my second day of the job!), as such I was a little lost at first, but learned some valuable lessons.
  
## Issue Overview
- The scan-to-email function had stopped working on two printers:  
  - **Xerox AltaLink C8155**  
  - **Brother MFC-L8900CDW**  
- Additionally, the **Windows Server 2012** was unable to send health report emails.  
- According to my supervisor, these issues had occurred several months ago without any known changes to the configuration or network setup.

## My Approach
### Initial Assessment
- To begin, I logged into the printer admin console by accessing its IP address in a web browser.
- I went to Properties > Scan To Email. This provided me with many SMTP configuration options as well as the ability to send a test email to see if the configuration is working.
