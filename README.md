# HelpDesk-Experience
Hi there! This repo is where I document my journey practicing help desk skills. It includes a mix of real-world problems I've solved, practice scenarios I created using a Jira setup, and hands-on work with Active Directory in my home lab. It's all about showcasing what I've learned and how I approach troubleshooting and support tasks.
