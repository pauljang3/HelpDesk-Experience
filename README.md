# Help Desk Practice and Experience

This is my repository where I document my journey into the world of IT support. I've been practicing help desk skills by working through a mix of real-world problems and practice scenarios that I set up myself. To make it feel as real as possible, I am using a ticketing system in Jira to track and resolve issues just like in a professional environment.

I've also been practicing using Active Directory in these scenarioes by using my [home lab,](https://github.com/pauljang3/HomeLab) tackling user and group management, group policies, and other directory service tasks to expand my skills.

## What You'll Find Here

- **[Real World Problems:](https://github.com/pauljang3/HelpDesk-Experience/tree/main/realproblems)** A collection of issues I've faced and resolved in actual environments. These give a glimpse into how I approach real challenges.
- **[Practice Scenarios:](https://github.com/pauljang3/HelpDesk-Experience/tree/main/practicescenarioes)** Simulated problems to cover a range of IT support topics, like troubleshooting network drives, fixing printer issues, and solving software problems. While these are mock scenarios, they reflect the kinds of issues a help desk analyst deals with daily.

## Why I Made This Repo

I wanted a way to track my progress, document what Iâ€™ve learned, and show what I can do. This repository helps me practice writing clear, professional documentation while also serving as a portfolio of my skills.
